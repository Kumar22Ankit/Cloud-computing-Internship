  ## Task 3 :

Scaling and Monitoring MongoDB Backup Application on AWS

1. Create Alerts for Failure

Set Up CloudWatch Alarms:

Open the CloudWatch Management Console.
Create an alarm for your EC2 instance.
Monitor specific metrics like CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, StatusCheckFailed, etc.
Set threshold values and actions for notifications.
Configure SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts via email/SMS.

Create SNS Topic for Notifications:

Open the SNS Management Console.
Create a topic (e.g., MongoDBBackupAlerts).
Subscribe an email endpoint to the topic.

2. Create Scaling Up / Scaling Down for the Application

Set Up Auto Scaling Group:
  Open the EC2 Auto Scaling Console.
  Create an Auto Scaling group and attach it to your existing EC2 instance setup.
  Define the desired number of instances, minimum, and maximum instances.

Configure Scaling Policies:

  Use CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling actions.
  Define policies for scaling up and scaling down based on metrics like CPU utilization.

3. Create CloudWatch Alarms for Scaling:

  Create alarms for scaling policies using CloudWatch.


Create Logging for Analytics Purpose

Set Up CloudWatch Logs:

Configure your application to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.
Install the CloudWatch Logs agent on your EC2 instance.

Example CloudWatch Logs agent setup:

sudo yum install -y awslogs
sudo service awslogs start
sudo chkconfig awslogs on


Configure Log Group and Stream:

  Open the CloudWatch Management Console.
  Create a log group (e.g., /var/log/mongodb-backup).
  Configure your application to write logs to this log group.

Enable Detailed Monitoring and Log Aggregation:

  Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for log analytics.
  Enable detailed monitoring for more granular metrics.



Conclusion : 
This setup ensures your MongoDB backup application is resilient, scalable, and well-monitored, 
providing insights into its performance and alerts in case of issues.
