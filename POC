POC (Proof Of Concept)
To create a proof of concept (POC) for an effective automatic MongoDB backup method, we'll follow these steps:

1. Set Up AWS EC2 Instance: 
   - Launch a free tier AWS EC2 instance.
   - Install MongoDB on the EC2 instance.

2.  Automate MongoDB Backup: 
   - Use a cron job to schedule regular backups.
   - Store backups in AWS S3 for durability and availability.

3.  Create Backup Script: 
   - Write a script to back up the MongoDB database and upload it to S3.
   - Ensure the script handles different backup and failure scenarios.

4.  Verify and Monitor Backups: 
   - Verify backups to ensure they are correctly created and stored.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for backup failures.

Conclusion

This POC provides a scalable and automated solution for backing up MongoDB databases using AWS services.
It ensures that Mr. John Doe can focus on more productive tasks without worrying about database backups.
The use of cron jobs for scheduling, AWS CLI for interacting with S3, and monitoring through CloudWatch creates a robust backup system.
