Automated MongoDB Backup Solution

Problem Statement :

Cloud Counselage's IT department faces a challenge with manually backing up MongoDB databases hosted on AWS EC2 instances.
This manual process is time-consuming and prone to human error. Mr. John Doe, who is responsible for these backups, spends a significant amount of time on this task,
which could be better utilized for more productive work.

Objective :

To develop an automated solution for continuous MongoDB database backups, leveraging AWS services to ensure efficiency, reliability, and minimal manual intervention.
The solution aims to free up Mr. John's time and streamline the backup process, ensuring data safety and consistency.

Solution Overview

Local Setup:

Create a Docker container for the MongoDB backup process.
Script the backup process to store backups in an S3 bucket.

Cloud Deployment:

Deploy the Docker container on an AWS EC2 instance.
Automate the deployment and updates using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous integration and delivery.
Automate updates to the backup solution to minimize manual interventions.

Tools and Technologies : 

1.AWS EC2: For hosting Docker containers.
2.Amazon S3: For storing MongoDB backups.
3.AWS IAM: For managing access and permissions.
